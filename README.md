This is the program to calculate the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGSs), and Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) by using the moving averaging filter(MAF), quadratic least squares (QLMS) method and moving median filter (MMF) for Brillouin optical fiber sensor and other distributed optical fiber sensor applications. The code is implemented into the paper published in the IEEE Sensor Journal. Feel free to use this code or the data, but please cite the following paper,
